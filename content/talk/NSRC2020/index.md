abstract: "Medical devices that can function in weightlessness are becoming increasingly necessary as humans push the boundaries of spaceflight with extended missions that cannot be quickly aborted in the case of a medical emergency. Astronauts must be able to solve medical anomalies as doctors would on Earth without the luxury of working with gravity. Many current medical devices require the use of gravity to function and must be modified or completely redesigned if they will be used by astronauts. This work presents the findings from a flight experiment of a thoracic drainage device for treating collapsed lungs that can function in weightlessness."
